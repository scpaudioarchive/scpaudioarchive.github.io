&lt;p>Around a week ago we posted the &lt;a href="https://scpaudioarchive.com/posts/s4/scp-1112">last episode of season 4&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering what to do with the podcast for a while (whether to continue or not). There have been a ton of life changes and events happening recently, for example I&amp;rsquo;m about to graduate high school and start university in a few months. However, this podcast is currently my main source of income, and we are extremely close to being monetized on YouTube.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will not be any season 4 bonus episodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Season 5 will be on Series 4 - selections from SCP-3056 to SCP-3100&lt;/strong>. As of the writing of this post, the specific numbers are still being planned out, but of course, progress will be visible on the Trello board. If you have a specific, please let us know soon - in the &lt;a href="https://scpaudioarchive.com/go/discord">Discord&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://scpaudioarchive.com/suggest">suggestions&lt;/a> page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will take a short break to have some time off, generate the artwork, update the website, and get a head start on recording and editing. The first episode will come &lt;strong>March 13th&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you all for the continued support. &lt;code>&amp;lt;3&lt;/code>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Season 5 Selection Poll</title><link>https://scpaudioarchive.com/posts/2021/12-02-s5-poll/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 11:14:17 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://scpaudioarchive.com/posts/2021/12-02-s5-poll/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello all!&lt;/p>

I have been quite busy with life in general lately, hence me not recording/ putting up an episode for around a month. Hopefully this blog post brings you all up to date.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="livestream-summary">Livestream Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;code>2021-02-06 20:30 EST (~1h 30m)&lt;/code> This was the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve tried this set up: a BigBlueButton room (hosted on &lt;a href="https://nixnet.services">NixNet Services&lt;/a>) that was livestreamed to YouTube using an old laptop running OBS. Minus some weird internet issues at the beginning with streaming, everything went pretty well!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think I&amp;rsquo;ll go with this setup moving on; I avoid streaming from my own laptop because that generates a lot of (fan) noise, which I&amp;rsquo;d rather not have to edit out. Since the BigBlueButton room will be open, you can join in there directly instead of watching the stream. Benefits are that you can talk (if you want) and show up on the stream, and also there&amp;rsquo;s less of a delay and higher quality audio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We recorded 2 SCPs that will be up very soon: SCP-2130 and SCP-087. We are also coming up on almost one year since I released my first episode, &lt;strong>thank you all&lt;/strong> for your support!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I took a look at what has been going on SCP-wise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have passed 300 subscribers on YouTube!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Due to &lt;em>gestures broadly&lt;/em> life, I&amp;rsquo;m planning on delaying Season 3. In the meantime I&amp;rsquo;ll continue reading listener suggestions and SCPs. I also plan to start working on a new theme for this site. It&amp;rsquo;ll be located &lt;a href="https://github.com/scpaudioarchive/theme">here&lt;/a>, if you have any experience in web design/ etc., please help out if you can!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks, and see you soon. ðŸ–¤&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Revamped Blog/ Website</title><link>https://scpaudioarchive.com/posts/2020/09/09-revamped-site/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scpaudioarchive.com/posts/2020/09/09-revamped-site/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi all!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve shared my interest in revamping the site on social media. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to reveal the new look.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the podcast and Youtube channel grows, I realize that I needed this site to also link to all those places, &lt;strong>per episode&lt;/strong>. That makes sure that listeners can listen on whatever platform they choose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that, old episodes (Season 1 and 2) will slowly be added to the blog, and links also slowly updated on the &lt;a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/audio-adaptations">SCP Audio Adaptations page&lt;/a> to point here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The form to &lt;a href="https://scpaudioarchive.com/suggest">suggest episodes&lt;/a> is also now baked in to the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the redesign, I&amp;rsquo;ve also brought in a new theme, that&amp;rsquo;s dark by default. It is called &lt;a href="https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/">Hello Friend NG&lt;/a>. You can find more information &lt;a href="https://scpaudioarchive.com/siteinfo">here&lt;/a>. As always, if you are interested in keeping this updated, please let me know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks for reading, and staying with me throughout the seasons 1 and 2!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>September Uploading Schedule</title><link>https://scpaudioarchive.com/posts/2020/09/12-sep-ep-schedule/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scpaudioarchive.com/posts/2020/09/12-sep-ep-schedule/</guid><description>&lt;p>My May - July release schedule was very infrequent, and thats something I want to avoid from now on. Season 2 has been going on since mid-April, and there&amp;rsquo;s a strong chance that if I stay with the schedule, it can be finished by the end of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="release-schedule-for-the-rest-of-august">Release schedule for the rest of August&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Twice a week! Every Wednesday and Sunday until September 2.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="release-schedule-for-the-september">Release schedule for the September&amp;hellip;?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for every Wednesday, every other Sunday.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, with COVID-19, I&amp;rsquo;ll still be doing some form of school in September - blended (1 day in school and the other online) or fully online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will probably attend fully online, just because it&amp;rsquo;s significantly safer and I don&amp;rsquo;t trust my school with all the necessary safety precautions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of this, I have no idea how busy I&amp;rsquo;ll actually be. While I definitely want to finish Season 2 by the end of December and move onto bonus episodes, unfortunately I can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee it ðŸ˜ž.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://scpaudioarchive.com/support">Patrons&lt;/a> will still release episodes as soon as I&amp;rsquo;m done editing them.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If there are any updates, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to &lt;a href="https://scpaudioarchive.com/links">announce them&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll also keep trying to schedule YT live streamed recordings and &lt;a href="https://scpaudioarchive.com/links">Discord recordings&lt;/a>, just keep in mind that they&amp;rsquo;ll happen on weekends/ at night (EST).&lt;/p>
&lt;hr></description></item><item><title>New Website!</title><link>https://scpaudioarchive.com/posts/2020/08/01-new-site/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scpaudioarchive.com/posts/2020/08/01-new-site/</guid><description>&lt;p>As you can tell, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved the SCP Foundation Audio Archive podcast&amp;rsquo;s website!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new address is: &lt;a href="">https://scpaudioarchive.github.io/&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully, this is easier to maintain and keep updated than my old site. All the useful links, spreadsheets, etc. have all been moved over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Yes, I am using Github pages to host this.) If you&amp;rsquo;re really interested, here&amp;rsquo;s the website&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/scpaudioarchive/scpaudioarchive.github.io">public GH repository&lt;/a> - feel free to file an issue if there&amp;rsquo;s something wrong. I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> and the theme &lt;a href="https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke">Ananke&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quick update on my release schedule: I&amp;rsquo;m still aiming for at least 1 episode per week (Sunday), but hopefully soon it&amp;rsquo;ll return to the usual 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks for reading!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Discord Server Launch!</title><link>https://scpaudioarchive.com/posts/2020/05/16-discord-server-launch/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scpaudioarchive.com/posts/2020/05/16-discord-server-launch/</guid><description>&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; this has been on my front page for a few days now. But, I thought I should make a proper post about it here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We now have a Discord server! It is creatively called &amp;ldquo;SCP Foundation Audio Archive Pod&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; LOL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s pretty small and I hope you join!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far, we will have episode discussions (every week/ new episode, if it&amp;rsquo;s one of my off weeks then we&amp;rsquo;ll have a different topic), bots (and more bots) and live episode recordings!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I record the episodes locally on my laptop as well, but I thought this was a great way so that you guys could sort of hear what goes on behind the scenes as well. The sound quality isn&amp;rsquo;t great at the moment, but I do plan on upgrading to another microphone soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most episodes will be live recorded, with the exception of some - they may be Patron-only live recordings, or if my internet is trash on that day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With all of that said, here is a &lt;a href="https://scpaudioarchive.com/go/discord">link to join&lt;/a>. I hope you enjoy it, please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to send feedback.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
